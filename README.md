# How the app works

This is a simple memory game built with React. 
* The application renders 15 Avengers: End Game GIF characters.
* Every time a GIF is clicked, the GIF's rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.
* The task for the user is to click on each GIF once and only once.
* The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score will be incremented when clicking an GIF for the first time.
*  Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
